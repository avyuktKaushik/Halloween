        Trick-or-treating is a traditional Halloween custom for 
        children and adults in some countries. In the evening 
        before All Saints' Day (1 November), children in costumes travel from house to 
        house, asking for treats with the phrase "Trick or treat". The "treat" is usually 
        some form of candy, although in some cultures money is given instead. The "trick"
         refers to a threat, usually idle, to perform mischief on the homeowner(s) or their
          property if no treat is given. Trick-or-treating usually occurs on the evening of 
          October 31. Some homeowners signal that they are willing to hand out treats by 
          putting up Halloween decorations outside their doors; others simply leave treats 
          available on their porches for the children to take freely. Houses may also leave 
          their porch light on as a universal indicator that they have candy.
        In Scotland and other parts of Britain and Ireland,
         the tradition of guising, going house to house at Halloween and putting on a 
         small performance to be rewarded with food or treats, goes back at least as far
          as the 16th century, as does the tradition of people wearing costumes at Halloween. 
          There are many accounts from 19th-century Scotland and Ireland of people going house
           to house in costume at Halloween, reciting verses in exchange for food, and 
           sometimes warning of misfortune if they were not welcomed.  
           While goinghouse to house in costumes has long been popular among the Scots and Irish, it 
           is only in the 2000s that saying "Trick or treat" has become common in Scotland 
           and Ireland. Prior to this, children in Ireland would commonly say "Help the 
           Halloween Party" at the doors of homeowners.
        In North America, trick-or-treating has been a Halloween tradition since the 
        1920s. The earliest known occurrence there of the Irish and Scottish Halloween 
        custom of "guising" – children going from house to house for food or money while 
        disguised in costume – is from 1911, when children were recorded as having done 
        this in Ontario, Canada.
        The activity is prevalent in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, 
        Canada, Australia, and northwestern and central Mexico. In the last, this practice 
        is called calaverita (Spanish diminutive for calavera, "skull" in English), and instead of 
        "Trick or treat", the children ask, "¿Me da mi calaverita?" 
        ("Can you give me my little skull?"), where a calaverita is a 
        small skull made of sugar or chocolate; although it’s still common 
        for other types of candy to be handed out.
